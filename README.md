# Secret Message Encoder / Decoder

## Overview
This project is a simple GUI-based application for encrypting and decrypting secret messages using a predefined password.\
It uses the ```Tkinter``` library to provide a user-friendly interface and the ```base64``` module for message encoding and decoding.

## Features
1. **Encrypt Messages:** Converts plaintext into base64-encoded text for secure storage or transmission.
2. **Decrypt Messages:** Converts base64-encoded text back to its original plaintext.
3. **Password Protection:** Ensures that only authorized users with the correct password can encrypt or decrypt messages.
4. **Reset Functionality:** Clears the input fields for reusability
